		Modified /DBView/GetErrors $_GET Values/validations to take the new redirection structure
		
		Modified /DBView/DatabaseStats $_GET Values/Validations to take the new redirection structure
		
		Modified /DBView/View_PDF (with the following): 
		
			1. The tool will now only create a page for the PDF View, if the data is within the necessary folder
			2. The tool has been modified to function differently based on the values of $_GET:
				2.1. Will only save the file to the database, if ?FileName is present when searching for $_GET values 
				
		Removed /DBView/index.php validations based on $_GET, as this is no longer required due to the restructured re-directs 
		
		Added a "New Notification" Counter on the main notification bars to display the number of 'new' errors/actioned errors since previous login 
			- This will update on every refresh, and has been a "soft" migration into the tool. Only highlighting over the boxes will display the value

			- Added first feature page to enable users of the application to view any stored PDF Documents

			- Input for the users date of birth is set to readonly, as a date of birth should not change. 
			- Added Readable statuses for the different user account type: 
				- 0 = Banned
				- 1 = Active
				- 2 = On Leave
